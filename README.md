# Running locally

In order to run the service against one of HMRC accounts (labs, live) it's needed to have an AWS accounts with proper
role. See [UpScan Accounts/roles](https://github.com/hmrc/aws-users/blob/master/AccountLinks.md)
for proper details.

Prerequisites:
- AWS accounts with proper roles setup
- Proper AWS credential configuration set up according to this document [aws-credential-configuration](https://github.com/hmrc/aws-users), with the credentials below:
```
[upscan-service-prototypes-engineer]
source_profile = webops-users
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE
output = json
region = eu-west-2
mfa_serial = arn:aws:iam::638924580364:mfa/your.username
role_arn = arn:aws:iam::415042754718:role/RoleServicePrototypesEngineer

[webops-users]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE
mfa_serial = arn:aws:iam::638924580364:mfa/your.username
region = eu-west-2
role_arn = arn:aws:iam::415042754718:role/RoleServicePrototypesEngineer
```
- Working AWS MFA authentication
- Have python 2.7 installed
- Install botocore and awscli python modules locally:
  - For Linux:
```
sudo pip install botocore
sudo pip install awscli
```
  - For Mac (Mac has issues with pre-installed version of ```six``` as discussed [here](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/3165):
```
sudo pip install botocore --ignore-installed six
sudo pip install awscli --ignore-installed six
```

In order to run the app against lab environment it's neeeded to run the following commands:
```
export AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE=name_of_proper_profile_in_dot_aws_credentials_file
./aws-profile sbt
```
These commands will give you an access to SBT shell where you can run the service using 'run' or 'start' commands.
